    Our love story began in the year 2008, when we first met at Renison, the residence we both lived in during our first year of undergrad at the University of Waterloo. However, while we lived in close spaces, the entire 8 months came and went with us being mere acquaintances and never really getting to know each other. <br/><br/>
    Fast forward 9 years to the spring of 2017 when, following the urging of Holly’s bestie Ashley (soon to be Maid of Honour), Holly was considering joining the popular dating site Match.com. Holly had never tried online dating before and felt hesitant, so decided to look through profiles of people in her area to decide whether or not it would be worth her time signing up. It was while looking through those profiles that she spotted Nick’s, immediately recognizing him as that cute guy she knew back in Renison. Holly remembered that she was friends with Nick on Facebook, so decided to reach out to him there to see if he would be interested in connecting. However, several days after seeing Nick’s profile and before reaching out to him, Holly learned that her mom had breast cancer and decided that the timing was not right, so never sent Nick a message. <br/><br/>
    Holly never forgot about Nick. He was often in the back of her mind and in the spring of 2019 Holly again decided to take a chance and reach out to Nick to see if he would be interested in connecting. Holly sent Nick a message on April 22nd, not knowing whether or not he was single or if he was still living in or around the Waterloo area. To say this message was a surprise for Nick would be an understatement, who had long ago cancelled his Match.com profile and was living in Edmonton. We believe the timing was fated, as Nick was headed back to Waterloo in two weeks to complete a school term for his Nano Engineering degree at the University of Waterloo. We began exchanging messages everyday for two weeks and joked that we were writing a novel together, as our messages to each other quickly exceeded 1,000 words a day. Our connection was instant and we soon felt like old friends. <br/><br/>
    We had our first date on May 7th and at the end of the night Holly knew that Nick was the one. We fell in love quickly, and began spending all our time together, from long hikes to axe throwing competitions to serene trips to the cottage.  At the end of August, we spent two weeks at Nick's parents place in Ottawa, and on August 26th spent an eventful day exploring much of our capital's history. After spending a romantic, starry night at parliament and watching a beautiful light show together, Nick waited until the  clock struck 11:11. Then he got down on one knee and asked Holly to marry him. The rest, as they say, is history!
